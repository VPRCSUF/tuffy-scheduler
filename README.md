## Tuffy Scheduler

The Tuffy Scheduler app is a course scheduling application. The program loads course information stored in a text file and finds a schedule that can accommodate as many of the courses provided. 
The software was designed using the object-oriented programming paradigm so that the code can easily be modified, extended, and scaled by other developers.
