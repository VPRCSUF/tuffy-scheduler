In all honesty, I am not entirely sure what the program does, but I do know that
it displays the best possible schedule to the user based on the courses in the
file provided.

# Challenges encountered

I encountered a lot of challenges. Mainly dealing with memory allocation.

I learned, like with the previous milestones, how important it is to stay
organized. I found myself getting lost A LOT while creating this program. I also
learned not to procrastinate and to get things done early so that if I encounter
any problems, I can get them resolved early.
